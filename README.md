A development of the filtering techniques titled- A semantic edge-aware parameter efficient image filtering technique.

To run the code locally:

Ensure you have installed MATLAB 2018a or a later version.

Download the file and make sure that all files remain in the same folder

Open a terminal

Open the main.m script from the saved folder

Choose the input image ( by changing the image name in "imread" function, there are two images named 'cartoon' and 'bee' which results are shown in the paper, you can add additional image to the InputImages folder )

Choose the parameter options - 'Widx' = 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 depending on the input image. (For details see the paper at- )

Run main.m script

Wait for the final results to come. ( It may take several minutes depending on the input image size as the code is not highly optimized)
