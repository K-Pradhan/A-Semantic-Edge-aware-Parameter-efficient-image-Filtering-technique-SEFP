This paper is accepted in Computers&Graphics journal. It is a MATLAB implementation in Windows 11.
SEPF ( Semantic Edge-aware Parameter-efficient image Filtering technique ) is the acronym of this work


To run the code locally:

Step 1: Ensure you have installed MATLAB 2018a or a later version.

Step 2: Download all the file included in this folder and make sure that all files saved in the same folder

Step 3: Open a terminal

Step 4: Open the main.m file from the saved folder

Step 5: Choose the input image in the first line of the script in main.m ( by changing the image name in "imread" function, there are two images named 'cartoon' and 'bee' which results are shown in the paper, you can add additional image to the InputImages folder )

Step 6: Choose the parameter (Widx) options in the second line - 'Widx' = 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 depending on the input image. (For details see the paper at- https://github.com/K-Pradhan/A-Semantic-Edge-aware-Parameter-efficient-image-Filtering-technique-SEFP-/blob/main/SEFP_PreprintAccepted_CAG_KP_SP.pdf)

Step 7: Run main.m script

Step 8: Wait for the final results to come. ( It may take several minutes depending on the input image size as the code is not highly optimized)
